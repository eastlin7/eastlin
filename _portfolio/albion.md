# Overview

Albion Online is a sandbox MMORPG set in an open medieval fantasy world. It has a fully player-driven economy; all equipment items are player-crafted.

When I started working at Sandbox-Interactive we were working out of an small apartment in East berlin (more preciesly in Rigaer Strasse the street known for its absurdly high "Dog shit per capita" ranking, or so I assume) we were a typical startup with around 14 people crammed in to our apartment, on the kitchen floor there was a server with an big note saying "DO NOT TOUCH" in German.

We did however quite rapidly grow, after we launched the early access program of Albion Online we were able to hire more people and move into a fancier office, we went up to 40 people during my stay and we worked out of a fancy office in the famed Kulturbrauerei right in one of Berlin's fancier hipster centers Prenzlauer Berg.  

## My Role

My role at Albion Online changed over time, at first i started as a Junior Designer but as the company grew my role grew into being a System Designer / Project Manager at Albion Online.
