# Overview

Aurora Digital was founded on a simple purpose â€“ disrupting the digital service industry. With our experienced team and an extensive network of partners in Digital Marketing & Web/Mobile development services, we help our clients worldwide get exactly what they want

We had heard a lot of the bad stories related to remote outsourcing, and as a company we decided that we will be a local agency that utalizes our network of partners to keep the costs down, as our team already had a lot of connections with people in the IT industry we were able to broker deals with large suppliers and our network currently reaches over 350 developers, designers and other IT professionals.
