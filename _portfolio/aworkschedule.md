# Overview
Aurora WorkSchedule was the first venture we at Aurora Digital went through, we had a contact in a company that were housing up to 400 maintanence workers and they were distributing their work schedules by printing out excel sheets and hanging them on the wall. 

We built a progressive web app which allows managers to simply upload the excel sheet and have it distributed to the entire workforce in seconds.

## Tech stack

Frontend: ReactJS

Backend: ExpressJS

## Achievements

We set out to make a simple web app, and we accomplished that, people are used to working with clunky tools and most of our target audience were not comfortable with learning new digital tools so we built something that would allow anyone update their company's work schedule with 3 clicks.
